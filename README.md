### Initial setup for the model

All the files required for setting up the model are in the `setup` directory. The data required has already been generated and saved in [calibrationData.mat](setup/calibrationData.mat) and [validationData.mat](setup/validationData.mat). 

In case the files are deleted, run the following commands from the home directory.

`
cd setup
setupModel.m
`

### Recreating figures

Each figure has a corresponding script that can be run from the home directory to recreate the figure.
